# Infinity Scroll

Webpage that pulls random photos from the Unsplash API and displays them on the page, and when you scroll to the very bottom it loads more photos giving an infinite scrolling effect.


## If you want to see it live

Create api.js and inside the file declare

```bash
const accessKey = "YOUR ACCESS KEY";
export { accessKey };
```

You can also use public key
```bash
